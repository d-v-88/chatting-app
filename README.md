## DESCRIPTION
Qonvo a Real-Time Chat App is a modern, messaging platform developed with a strong focus on React.js for the frontend, showcasing my ability to build responsive, dynamic, and user-friendly web applications. As part of my React.js internship, I developed the frontend using functional components, React Hooks, and Context API to handle authentication, real-time messaging, and user interaction. The application begins with a robust authentication flow—new users can sign up by providing basic details, and returning users can securely log in with their credentials. Upon successful login or signup, users receive a prompt indicating that they have been successfully logged in, and their online status is updated in real time. Other users can also see if someone is online or offline through a status indicator next to their name, helping simulate a live chat environment. The core chat functionality supports real-time text messaging, where messages appear instantly in the chat window using Socket.IO and WebSocket-based communication. In addition to text, users can send photos and videos within the conversation. Media files are uploaded and displayed within the chat window using dynamic React components, and users can click on an image to view it in an enlarged, full-screen modal view—improving usability and visual engagement. A clean and responsive layout ensures that all chat elements, including messages, media, user info, and input fields, work seamlessly across devices. Each user has a profile section where they can update their profile picture and bio. This feature allows users to personalize their identity on the platform, and changes are instantly reflected using React’s state management. The app also have a logout button for the user to logout and the user can then log in and chat again. The app also utilizes conditional rendering and context for managing user data globally, ensuring that profile updates and authentication states persist across different components and pages. Navigation between pages like login, signup, profile, and chat dashboard is handled using React Router for a smooth single-page application experience. Axios is used to handle all API requests between the React frontend and the backend server, ensuring secure and fast communication. The app uses proper form validations for signup and login inputs, giving instant feedback for errors like invalid emails or missing fields. Loading indicators, success messages, and error modals enhance the user experience and make the UI more interactive. The structure of the React app is modular and scalable, with reusable components for chat bubbles, media viewers, user cards, and form inputs. Environment configurations and deployment readiness are included, making it suitable for both development and production stages. This project demonstrates my ability to integrate React.js with backend services, real-time data flow, user authentication, media handling, and dynamic UI updates—all essential aspects of building real-world, production-ready applications. Overall, this chat app is a complete demonstration of my frontend skills with React.js, my understanding of full-stack development, and my attention to user experience and design, making it a strong portfolio project from my internship.
